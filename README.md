## 📌 Project Overview
This project provides a **Payroll Management Dataset** (1,000 employees) for practicing SQL queries.  
It covers **basic, intermediate, and advanced SQL problems** such as filtering, aggregation, joins, and analytics.

## 📂 Files Included
- `payroll_dataset.csv` → Payroll dataset (employee details, salaries, joining/leaving dates, status)
- `queries.sql` → SQL queries (basic → advanced)
- `README.md` → Project documentation

## 🛠 Schema
The dataset has the following columns:

- EmployeeID  
- FullName  
- Email  
- Department  
- JobTitle  
- PayGrade

Which department has the most employees?

What is the average salary per department?

Who are the top 5 highest-paid employees?

How many employees resigned within 2 years of joining?

What is the yearly hiring trend?

What’s the average salary per pay grade & employment status?

2. Run the queries in `queries.sql`.  
3. Analyze results to gain insights.
